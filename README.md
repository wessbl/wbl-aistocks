# FutureStock AI

A Flask-based LSTM application that predicts future stock prices for selected tickers.

## Description

This application trains LSTM models on selected stock tickers and continuously updates them. With every new closing price, the app loads a pre-trained model from an SQLite database. If the market has closed since the last prediction, the model is updated, a new prediction is generated, and both are saved. Results include formatted text and visualizations.

> **Note:** This is a portfolio project demonstrating AI integration and should not be interpreted as financial advice.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3
* `requirements.txt` includes all necessary packages such as Flask, TensorFlow, Pandas, etc.

### Installing

* Install git, python3, python3-pip, pip3 as needed
* Clone the project to your desired directory
* Create the virtual environment. Go into the project folder and run:
``` 
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Executing program

* Open a terminal to the root directory
* To run the app in development mode:
``` 
python app.py
```
This will launch the app locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.


## Help

* For a basic walkthrough, see my [Jupyter Notebook Version](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1z96VjkJXcIOQ6KdNjEPjhmxKKfLd7FLH).
* The app starts fresh when `model.db` is deleted: `static/models/model.db`.
* To tweak performance or accuracy, adjust the global variables in `model/lstm_model.py`. For example, lowering `epochs` speeds up training but reduces accuracy.
